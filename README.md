This is my solution for the the Betting Host Tabcorp Coding Challenge. Written in primarily in TypeScript. I went for a more OOP approach.

## Installation & Running
1. Run `yarn install` or `npm install`
2. Run `yarn start < stdin` or `npm start < stdin` on Mac/Unix, `cat stdin | yarn start` or `cat stdin | npm start` on Windows
